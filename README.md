This repo is an exploration of the ability of a Haxe macro to create
the "include" language feature. In AS3/cpp, the include directive is
fairly flexible, allowing the definition of functions, constants, etc.

I've started from code mentioned in [a conversation](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/haxelang/subject$3Ainclude/haxelang/AeoT7VFKEmw/lCCmL76kr7cJ) on the mailing list.

But I haven't been able to get quite the behavior I'd hope for -- please
see the issues in this repo for details.

My macro skills are quite limited, and I hope that others will submit
PR's to bring the Haxe include functionality in closer parity to that
of other languages.
